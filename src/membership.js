        content: `Futsal is a variant of association football played on a hard court, smaller than a football pitch, and mainly indoors. Futsal is played between two teams of five players each, one of whom is the goalkeeper. The main emphasis of the game is on “improvisation, creativity, and technique.”

            The sport of futsal is taking the country by storm, especially in metros like Hyderabad, where getting the young generation involved in sports itself is a challenge, just because the sport becomes very interesting because of the small ground that keeps on moving the scoreboard making it short and crisp. Futsal brings up two crucial factors that play into the hands of people in metros – Small spaces and five-a-side. When you hear out to a football player’s heart, we will find the echo of a waving flag still running. That’s the measure of love the sport has.

            We present you the best standard futsal/ indoor football court for all the football lovers out there. So, no wait! Kick in, and get your memberships done with us.`,
